As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status and religion (or lack thereof).

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.
